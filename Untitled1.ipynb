        "### **Question 1:** What is Dimensionality Reduction? Why is it important in machine learning?\n",
        "\n",
        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "Dimensionality Reduction means reducing the number of input variables (features) in a dataset while keeping as much meaningful information as possible.  \n",
        "In machine learning, more features often mean more complexity. Some features may be redundant, noisy, or highly correlated — and these can confuse the model instead of helping it learn better.\n",
        "\n",
        "This technique is important because:\n",
        "- It **speeds up training and computation**, especially when working with large-scale datasets.\n",
        "- It **reduces overfitting**, since simpler models generalize better.\n",
        "- It helps us **visualize data** that originally exists in high dimensions (like 30, 100, or 1000 features).\n",
        "- It improves storage efficiency and removes noise, making learning more stable and accurate.\n",
        "\n",
        "Think of it like **compressing a large file into a smaller smart folder** without removing anything important.\n"

        "1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** – Converts features into new uncorrelated variables (principal components) that capture maximum variance. It is a linear technique commonly used for numerical datasets.  \n",
        "2. **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)** – Focuses on preserving local relationships, used mainly for visualization of high-dimensional data. Best for patterns and grouping, not for large-scale transformation.  \n",

        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "Clustering is an unsupervised technique where the machine groups similar data points together without using labels or predefined outputs. The goal is to discover hidden structure or natural groupings inside the dataset.\n",
        "\n",

        "- **K-Means Clustering** – Divides data into 'K' clusters based on similarity (distance from cluster center).  \n",
        "- **DBSCAN** – Density-based clustering, detects clusters of any shape and manages noise/outliers effectively.  \n",
        "- **Hierarchical Clustering** – Creates a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to represent nested clusters.\n",
        "\n",

        "**Answer:**  \n",
        "Anomaly Detection is the process of identifying data points, patterns, or observations that differ significantly from normal behavior. These anomalies are often unexpected and can indicate important insights — like fraud, system failures, rare diseases, security threats, or sensor errors.\n",

        "- In banking: Helps detect **fraudulent transactions**.\n",
